This will be no ordinary `Emacs`_ blog.  Or scratch that, this will be
a rough equivalent of what `Geoff Greer`_ tried to achieve by exposing
gruesome `Vim`_ code, but :strike:`shamelessly ripped off from`
inspired by the `OpenSSL Valhalla`_, a blog collecting the greatest
commit log messages written by the people who managed improving the
`OpenSSL`_ library to the point of creating `a safer alternative`_.  I
do not intend to reach that level of philantropy for Reasonsâ„¢, however
I hope to at the very least entertain whoever may find this blog.

Enjoy!
