Makefile.in_ is a file suitable for dirty hacks affecting Makefiles_
generated by autotools_.  Look what I've found:

.. code:: makefile

   # Bootstrapping right is difficult because of the circular dependencies.
   # Furthermore, we have to deal with the fact that many compilation targets
   # such as loaddefs.el or *.elc can typically be produced by any old
   # Emacs executable, so we would like to avoid rebuilding them whenever
   # we build a new Emacs executable.
   # To solve the circularity, we use 2 different Emacs executables,
   # "emacs" is the main target and "bootstrap-emacs" is the one used
   # to build the *.elc and loaddefs.el files.
   # To solve the freshness issue, we used to use a third file "witness-emacs"
   # which was used to witness the fact that there is a bootstrap-emacs
   # executable, and then have dependencies on witness-emacs rather than
   # bootstrap-emacs, but that lead to problems in parallel builds (because
   # witness-emacs needed to be free from dependencies (to avoid rebuilding
   # it), so it was compiled in parallel, leading typically to having 2
   # processes dumping bootstrap-emacs at the same time).
   # So instead, we replace the witness-emacs dependencies by conditional
   # bootstrap-dependencies (via $(BOOTSTRAPEMACS)).  Of course, since we do
   # not want to rely on GNU Make features, we have to rely on an external
   # script to do the conditional part of the dependency
   # (i.e. see the $(SUBDIR) rule ../Makefile.in).

Sometimes I wish to be in an alternative universe where tup_ has taken
over as build tool for any large project and `GNU Make`_ has been
banished into something used by academia only.
